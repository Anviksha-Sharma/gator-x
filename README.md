# Gator-X
# Project Idea:
The brainstroming behind the creation of Gator-X includes the difficulties new students face in finding their go-to hangout spot in Gainesville. In Gator-X, students suggest students to get the best out of Gainesville in accordance to their tastes during their tenure as a UF student. Gator-X ensures that the reviews provided in the website are diverse and accurate so that all types of students at UF can have nice time and meet like-minded people.
