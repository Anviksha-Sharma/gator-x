## Description of Gator-X:
		
Gator-X was designed with the intention of elaborately expressing one's views so that an individual's first visit to a place which can be either a restaurant, park, or a club will be well suited to his taste and the individual can have a great experience. Gator-X is the short form for Gator Experience. The primary location kept in mind while designing this website is Gainesville, the home of Gators. Though Gainesville is mostly seen as a town of students, it has a diverse population distribution catering needs of various age groups. It often gets tough for people to identify the places that suit their taste if the individual is new to Gainesville and does not find a way to explore Gainesville. Gator-X provides an opportunity for visitors/residents in Gainesville to find themselves and meet like-minded people. With the collaboration of people with diverse experiences, our team was able to find the solution. The main functionalities and features of Gator-X are described in detail below with a video demonstration showcasing the working of the website. 

## Tasks accomplished in Sprint 4:
### 1. Frontend:
* Added Upload image feature to reviews: The user will now be able to add images in addition to the text, category of the place and the author name which is can show the other users the real condition of a place versus the advertised pictures which will help users in making the right choice to pick a place.
* Added SearchBar component to navbar: The user will now be able to search to find exactly what the user wants instead of browsing which will save the time for the user.
* Added Ratings feature: The user will now be able to add rating to a review in the range of 1-5 which showcases the degree of the experience a user had at a place which correlates to the overall experience of a user including hospitality, customer service and the place offering.
* End-to-end testing using cypress: All the new features added to the frontend have been end-to-end tested and the tests can be found at https://github.com/kamalsairajk/Gator-X/tree/main/frontend/cypress
