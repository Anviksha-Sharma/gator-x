# Sprint 4 

## Project Description:
Want to eat out but can’t decide where? Want to tour new places but can’t figure out what to do?

Gator-X is here to your rescue!

Exploring new places is fun but figuring out what to do can be perplexing. Gator-X is designed with the intention of elaborately expressing one's views about a café or museum. A user can easily browse through the reviews about a place that helps them to make an informed choice and thus enhance their experience. Gator-X stands for Gator-Experience! 

The primary location kept in mind while designing this website is Gainesville, the home of Gators. Though Gainesville is mostly seen as a town of students, it has a diverse population distribution catering needs of various age groups. It often gets tough for people to identify the places that suit their taste especially if they are new to the city. Gator-X provides an opportunity for visitors/residents to find new adventures and meet like-minded people in the process. A user can post, edit, delete and view reviews posted on the app. They can search and filter the posts according to different categories. Hence, Gator-X helps users save time and make the most of their time spent in Gator-land.

## Tasks accomplished in Sprint 4:
### 1. Frontend:
* **Added Upload image feature to reviews**: The user will now be able to add images in addition to the text, category of the place and the author name. This shows the users the real condition of a place versus the advertised pictures which will help users in making the right choice to pick a place.

* **Added SearchBar component to navbar**: The user will now be able to search to find exactly what they want. They need not waste their precious time in browsing.

* **Added Ratings feature**: The user will now be able to add rating to a review in the range of 1-5 which showcases the degree of the experience a user had at a place which correlates to the overall experience of a user including hospitality, customer service and the place offering.

* **End-to-end testing using cypress**: All the new features added to the frontend have been end-to-end tested and the tests can be found at [Tests](https://github.com/kamalsairajk/Gator-X/tree/main/frontend/cypress)
