Description of Gator-X:
		
Gator-X was designed with the intention of elaborately expressing one's views so that an individual's first visit to a place which can be either a restaurant, park, or a club will be well suited to his taste and the individual can have a great experience. Gator-X is the short form for Gator Experience. The primary location kept in mind while designing this website is Gainesville, the home of Gators. Though Gainesville is mostly seen as a town of students, it has a diverse population distribution catering needs of various age groups. It often gets tough for people to identify the places that suit their taste if the individual is new to Gainesville and does not find a way to explore Gainesville. Gator-X provides an opportunity for visitors/residents in Gainesville to find themselves and meet like-minded people. With the collaboration of people with diverse experiences, our team was able to find the solution. The main functionalities and features of Gator-X are described in detail below with a video demonstration showcasing the working of the website.
