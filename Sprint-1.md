Front-end Documentation:

Gator X:

Gator X is meant is to be a on-point guide for the UF students where they get accurate reviews which are close to reality. For the first sprint, we have created a basic skeleton-like frontend structure which includes three 3 pages. The technologies used in building the client-side application are React.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1st page:

The first page is the home page of the website which contains the logo of the website and the featured reviews of various places in Gainesville which will be added as one of the features in the upcoming sprints. The page contains three links which are Home, Register and Login. The Home link directs the user to the home page. The register link allows the user to create an account in the website. The login link allows the user to login the website and add any reviews if he wishes to. 

2nd page:

The second page is the register page for the user where he has provide details like his name, email address and a password for the account. It can be observed that the user cannot create an account if he does not include ‘@’ symbol and ‘.com’ in the email address he is providing.

3rd page:

The third page contains the login links for the user. The third page allows the website to authenticate the user so that the user’s account is secure and not misused. If the user logs into the website, the user will be able to react to the reviews so that the reviews replicate the reality and the user will be able to add any reviews in addition to reading the reviews for having with his loved ones.

Here is a sample video of the User Interaction with the website:
